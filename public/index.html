                                We provide tools to help college students collaborate in and out of the lecture hall with peers and instructers alike.  It is easy to begin taking class notes online.  Just <a href="/register" id="sign_up-link">register</a>, find or create your courses, and share the link with your classmates.</p> 
                            <p>
                                In addition to realtime collaborative note-taking, you can ask questions for your peers to promote or answer. While you use our tools, bear in mind that FinalsClub is a non-profit, free and open source project.  Please be patient and let us know how we can improve our products.  Only together can we digitize higher education, one lecture at a time.

			<h1>Team</h1>
			<p>Thank you for your interest in FinalsClub.org and our community of volunteer developers, organizers, and scholars.  Although we come from diverse backgrounds, each of us is committed to open education.  Just as some of us struggle to remember the world before Wikipedia, we also look forward to a time in the not-too-distant future when people will no longer fathom a world without free and open education for everyone. &nbsp;Although we have an ambitious goal for a small team of believers ranging from nineteen to seventy years old, we believe we can succeed.  But before we can open the ivory tower to curious minds everywhere, we will need your help.</p>

<h2>Andrew Magliozzi - Chief Bottle Washer </h2>
<p>Andrew is an entrepreneur and a dreamer.  He is also the reason FinalsClub exists today, but he also recognizes that the success of this project depends more on its student contributors than its founder.  Since the creation of the first site in 2008, Andrew has remained committed to the cause of open education without distraction.  If you are looking to join our team, Andrew is the person to talk to for inspiration and enthusiasm.  When he is not teaching, tutoring, or being a <a href="http://pleasestealthisidea.com">social entrepreneur</a>, Andrew is a writer and avid practitioner of Italian Yoga.</p>

<h2>Seth Woodworth - Ed Tech All-star</h2>
<p><a href="http://sethish.com/">Seth is</a>&nbsp;a professional web developer, education technologist, and free and open source&nbsp;enthusiast. Over the past three years, Seth has been employed in the field of open source educational technology with <a href="http://one.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a>, the Harvard Berkman Center's <a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/">Web Ecology Project</a>, and <a href="http://oneville.org/">OneVille</a>.  Now we are happy to have Seth leading software development here at FinalsClub.org.</p>

<h2>Joshua Gay - Sheep Herder</h2>
<p>During his day job at the Free Software Foundation, Josh is an avid believer in free and open source software.  His interest in open education has also brought his expertise to other projects such as <a href="http://textbookrevolution.org/">TextbookRevolution.org</a> and <a href="http://www.ck12.org/">CK12.org</a>.  Now he lives in Cambridge, MA and dedicates his spare cycles to charting the course of our development team and helping to strategize our community organizing efforts.  When not working or writing free and open source software, Josh likes to play squash.  Care to challenge him to a match?</p>

<h2>Bob Call - Tireless Watchman</h2>
<p>Bob is our heroic systems administrator.  His task is to make sure your knowledge stays safe and secure from all manner of malware, hacker, or system failure.  His enthusiasm and passion for secure passwords is unrelenting.  In short, your knowledge is safe with him.  When he isn't busy debugging or encrypting, Bob is likely contributing to free and open source software projects (even though he should be studying for his college mid terms).</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>If you are reading this, you likely have one question in mind: What's
 up with this site?   Based on the subtle "About" link you followed 
here, it would seem that someone claims to have an answer.  For the time
 being, that someone is me, the site's founder.  I don't, however, have 
all the answers.  Over the past three years, I've done a lot of thinking
 about collaborative learning, the Internet, and this website, but I do 
not wish to impose all of my preconceptions on you.  While I will share 
the vision that inspired this project, I defer to you to complete - or 
better, to improve upon - what I've started.</p>

				<h2>The Inspiration</h2>
				<p>I have been a tutor since I was fourteen years old.  I have 
taught every conceivable demographic from prep schoolers to juvenile 
prisoners.  Sometimes I have been paid; other times I've volunteered.  
In short, I love teaching and I feel that a certain level of education 
should be free to everyone.  As a result, I have always balanced my paid
 and pro bono work.</p>
				<p>After starting a boutique tutoring firm, <a href="http://www.veritutors.com/">Veritas Tutors</a>,
 in 2005, I soon decided to increase my commitment to public education 
in accord with the growth of my company.  With my mornings generally 
free, I also seized the opportunity to audit a number of classes on the 
Harvard campus.</p>
				<p>Loitering in the back of lecture halls with the other 
intellectual ne'er-do-wells of Harvard Square, I realized my flexible 
schedule and geographic proximity alone afforded me the privilege of 
world-class academic enrichment.  I also thought, "Why shouldn't those 
less free to indulge in leisurely midday contemplation be afforded the 
same opportunity?"</p>
				<p>Soon after that epiphany, my first academic blog, based on "The 
Art and Thought of the Cold War", was published on a homebrewed website 
in the Fall of 2005.  After each lecture, I would scurry to a coffee 
shop to organize, summarize, and analyze what I'd learned.  Even though 
my readership was minimal, the process of learning without the burden of
 exams or papers was fantastic.  That is, until the professor learned of
 my actions and demanded that I cease writing and remove the blog from 
public view.  Shocked and disappointed, I complied.  I also resolved to 
revive the project at some point in the future.</p>
				<p>Two years of contemplation later, the first version of this 
website launched with four annotated books and five course blogs, which I
 took care to edit and pre-approve with a combination of diplomacy and 
obeisance to each professor.  With relative success on and off campus, I
 have continued efforts to expand the site into the collaborative 
learning environment that currently exists.</p>

				<h2>The State of FinalsClub.org</h2>
				<p>This site is straightforward.  Its three fundamental features 
involve annotations, courses, and groups with all information shared 
under a Creative Commons Copyright in compliance with the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act.  Please read our (official copyright policy 
[link]) for more information.</p>
				<p>Specifically, annotations constitute observations a great tutor 
would make if you read a book side-by-side.  Courses involve 
lecture-by-lecture op-eds written by enrolled students.  Finally, groups
 are forums for organizing, collaborating, and sharing knowledge 
garnered inside or outside the ivory tower of academia.  To view a 
sample group, please (click here [link]).</p>
				<p>Thanks to several intrepid scholars, the site already includes 
ample content to read, contemplate, and augment.  If you are a student 
at [one of our participating universities (link)], you have benefited or
 likely will benefit from this existing content.  In exchange, I simply 
ask you to contribute in kind.</p>
				<p>If you like what you read, vote it up; if you have a relevant 
comment, post it; and if you have the opportunity, join or create a 
study group to share your coursework with the world.</p>

				<h2>The Future of FinalsClub.org</h2>
				<p>Until now, I have been responsible for everything that appears on
 the website.  I have engaged, edited, and overseen the creation of all 
technology and content.  However, the success of this site has nothing 
to do with past accomplishments or future innovation.  Rather, the 
success of this site depends on you, readers and contributors, and your 
commitment to academic openness.  I have created the forum and crafted 
examples, but you must determine the rest.</p>
				<p>Students, teachers, and curious minds the world over have already
 found this site to be invaluable.  Moreover, people are beginning to 
recognize that educational equality and open access to information 
constitute two of the Internet's greatest (and yet unrealized) promises.
  With a widespread effort, we can forever alter the landscape of 
education.</p>
				<p>For now, I've done my small part; the rest is up to you.</p>
				<p>Optimistically yours,<br />
				Andrew Magliozzi<br />
