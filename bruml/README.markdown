# backchannel

is a reimplementation of the features of backchan.nl using a node.js 
server with the socket.io module.  It is intended for HTML5 capable
browsers supporting websockets.  The project will migrate towards a component
stucture with a javascript library to be used on the HTML page and a node
module to be used on the server, each containing no presentation.  Examples 
of practical ways to skin the functionality will available as part of the 
project.
