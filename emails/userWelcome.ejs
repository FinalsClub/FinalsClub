<p>Dear <%= user.name %>,</p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="http://finalsclub.org">FinalsClub.org</a> an online learning community to help young scholars learn better, faster, and smarter.  Now that you have created an account, after you activate, you can log in to add your courses and lectures.  You can also invite your peers to collaborate and learn together in realtime.</p>

<p>Instead of typing in isolation, you can take notes together and share your academic activity for the common good.  In addition to helping you learn more with less work, FinalsClub allows you to share your contributions beyond the classroom.  Open Courseware was created by administrators at MIT, Yale, Berkeley and other innovative universities.  FinalsClub, however, is a bottom-up project that relies on the entire academic community to change academic knowledge from a private privilege to a free and open resource for everyone.</p>

<p>Although our tools are essential, the ultimate success of this project relies not on technology but on co-learners like you.  Together we can change how people learn everywhere, one class at a time.</p>

<p>
Thank you for sharing,<br>
Andrew Magliozzi<br>
