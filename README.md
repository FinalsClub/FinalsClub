# Finals Club 

This is the source code repository for [finalsclub.org](http://finalsclub.org/).

FinalsClub.org is a 501(c)(3) non-profit open education project dedicated to
helping college students collaborate, learn, and share their knowledge freely online.



# Overview

FinalsClub.org consists of 3 main parts:

- The collaborative, real-time editor
- The back channel
- The surrounding website


## The Collaborative Real-time Editor 

The real-time editor is an embedded editor called
[Etherpad-Lite](https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite) (EPL).
It provides the ability for multiple people to simultaneously edit a single document.
The documents in Finals Club are the notes for a specific lecture.


## The Back Channel (BC)

The back channel portion of Finals Club is called ["BC"](https://github.com/FinalsClubDev/BC).
BC allows the note takers, or anyone else who is just observing,
to suggest questions for the lecturer, and vote on each other's questions.
It also allows people to post commentary.


## The Surrounding Website

This is the Finals Club website, which brings together the other two elements into
a single website that serves it's stated purpose (above).
This would be the home page, privacy policy page, the page that lists the participating
schools, the sub pages containing lists of lectures and note taking sessions, and the
core page where EPL and BC are both found along side each other.
